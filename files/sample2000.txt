12.1 Birthday Attacks
If there are 23 people in a room, the probability is slightly more than 50% that two of them have the same birthday. If there are 30, the probability is around 70%. This might seem surprising; it is called the birthday paradox. Let’s see why it’s true. We’ll ignore leap years (which would slightly lower the probability of a match) and we assume that all birthdays are equally likely (if not, the probability of a match would be slightly higher).

Consider the case of 23 people. We’ll compute the probability that they all have different birthdays. Line them up in a row. The first person uses up one day, so the second person has probability (1−1/365) of having a different birthday. There are two days removed for the third person, so the probability is (1−2/365) that the third birthday differs from the first two. Therefore, the probability of all three people having different birthdays is (1−1/365)(1−2/365). Continuing in this way, we see that the probability that all 23 people have different birthdays is

(1−1365)(1−2365)⋯(1−22365)=.493.
Therefore, the probability of at least two having the same birthday is

1−.493=.507.
One way to understand the preceding calculation intuitively is to consider the case of 40 pe
